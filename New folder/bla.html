<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph starts off with this stupid sentence.the secand sentence is no better than the first.

i tried changing line for this one but i'm not sure if it'll work.I mean it should work but let's see.also i hate that this does not automatically capitalize alphabets after a fullstop.
ok so edit: it does not work. i'm dissapointed :/</p>
